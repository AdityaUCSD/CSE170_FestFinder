        <p>Fun for the whole family to enjoy! Presenting a list of films that
				famous world around, including classics and new hits, but what's really
				the icing on the cake are the three short films made and produced by
				students from the local school districts. Jay Peters, founder of the
				event and La Jolla resident, wanted to find a way to give back to the
				community and remind people of the classic films that he and others
				adored when they were children. The new films draw in the crowds, and the
				older films are a wonderful discovery for folks of all ages. Jay really
				wanted to buid his community, however, leading him to also include a film
				competition for elementary school, junior high school, and high school.
				He hopes this incentive for filmmaking will encourage youth to pursue a
				dream he wish he could have pursued as a child. Come bring the family
				and expect to be wow'd!</p>
