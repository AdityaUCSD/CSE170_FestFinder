        <p>Joe King is one heck of a funny guy! Born in Fullerton, California, Joe King learned that laughter was certainly the 
		best remedy to any ailment. In elementary school, he was always the class clown and performed comedy bits
		imitating the faculty during the talent show, and even the teachers were laughing! In high school, he started up
		his own improv club which was a class favorite during pep rallies. Now that he's an undergrad at UC San Diego,
		he's bringing his humor to us. He started with stand up shows on the UCSD campus, "just for laughs" he said, but
		after some encouragement from his roommates he is now taking his humor to local bars and stages in SD County.
		We especially love his puns. Look up when you'll be hearing him joke!</p>
